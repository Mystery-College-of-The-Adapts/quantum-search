# quantum-search
An implementation of Grover's Algorithm using IBM Quantum Experience 

This program uses a local quantum computer simulator to run Grover's algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm).

The computer runs on two quantum registers and two classical registers and measures the count of each search input based upon an oracle function (controlled CNOT gate).
